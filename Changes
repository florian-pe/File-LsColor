  - properly support dircolors keys with a wildcard and no extension, for
    example *MANIFEST, *README
  - can_ls_color() can now accept whitespace padded queries as well as both a
    naked extension and a full filname, e.g perl_is_best.pm
  - now properly support the following file attributes:
      * symlink
      * executable
      * directories
      * sockets
      * named pipes
      * block devices
      * character special files
    keep in mind that since a stat() needs to take place, this will only work
    with resolvable paths to real files.
  - the GNU default dircolors have been updated.
